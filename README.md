# Ray-tracing-algorithm C++
Ray tracing is a fundamental rendering algorithm. It is commonly used for animations and architectural simulations, in which the quality of the created images is more important than the time it takes to create them.This is an implementation of  a basic ray tracer that simulates the propagation of light in the real world.
